# Purpose: runner script which executes all commands to get GC-matched negative
# or background training regions, using
# an array job to limit the number of jobs in the queue.
# 1) 08-write_cmds.sh first loops over datasets and generates all commands
# 2) 08-run.sh is then submitted to the scheduler, which creates an array job over all cmds in 08-commands.sh
# 3) 08-get_negatives.sh is called by each command.
